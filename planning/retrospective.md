**Stop doing :** 

**Continue doing:** 

* Read, watch and learn
* Use GitHub for daily communication over ther project(comments to PR's and issues)
* Use Project Board and get better and better in making and correcting Issues for the project

**Start Doing:** 

* Write more detailed Development Strategy, which will, probably, come with more knowledge about web-development(what specifically should be done to get specific results)
* Meet to discuss Retropsective in details

**Lessons learned:** 

  * We've learned a lot about developing website:
       * reverse-ingeneering the page
       * practising Flex
       * everyone learned new things while doing their part of the job and watching others do their parts
       
  * We've learned a lot about working together on GitHub, like  
      * attaching issues to PRs and autamatically closing them when PR is accepted
      * definetly got better with team work flow: rebase, fetch upstream, update own branch before pushing changes and etc
      * assigning Issues on project board to yourself
