# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

- deadline: 26, January
- github pages only
- no JavaScript, only HTML and CSS
- we have no tutorial, only website itself

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

- team members level of coding experience is low
-

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
-->

- A team member is not reached; so one person less in development
- Group can vote to make decisions, majority wins.
- Availability of the team members [see the time table](README.md)
- We skip sections or elements we can't replicate, they can be replaced we placeholders or alike items.
